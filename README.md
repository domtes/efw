I want to re-create an effect similar to the one used in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGK6eceWyU4&t=1264s).

It looks like a chrome-less browser window, which also can be rendered with transparency against the desktop.

It looks like it's possible to achieve a similar effect with minimal
efforts using [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/) library and [frameless windows](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/window-customization#create-frameless-windows).
